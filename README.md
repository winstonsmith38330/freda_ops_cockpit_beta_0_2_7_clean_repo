# Freda Ops Cockpit - Beta 0.2.7

Beta 0.2.7 is a local-first View Sync patch. It fixes pasted/browser POS captures so they update Live Sales, renames backend POS scraping to a diagnostic, and caches captured POS/Uber/Square values in the browser so the dashboard does not remain frozen after failed server-side sync.


This is a clean, full package intended to be uploaded to a **new GitHub branch or new GitHub repository at the repository root**. It avoids the previous nested-folder confusion.

## What is included

- Mobile-first PWA app in `web/`
- Node/Express server in `server/`
- Valid JavaScript seed file: `web/assets/seed-data.js`
- Pure JSON seed file: `seed-data.json`
- POS connector diagnostics for reporting.site
- Clear sales period labels:
  - POS Today / POS captured period
  - Uber WTD unless a daily snapshot is entered
  - Square MTD / captured period for Frieda's Pies
- Freda feedback section:
  - hour-by-hour same-day comparison requirement
  - sell-out timing tracker
  - planned FOMO vs operational sell-out distinction
  - leftovers and first-sold-out tracker
  - balls vs rings production mix, with the current seed assumption around 65% balls for specials
  - stock photo / two-trip stock planner
  - hiring and training as top management priorities
- Cache-busted service worker: `freda-ops-cockpit-beta-0-2-3-final-v3`

## Recommended GitHub setup

Create a new branch or a new repository and upload the **contents of this folder** so the GitHub root shows:

```text
db
docs
scripts
server
web
README.md
seed-data.json
```

Do not upload it as:

```text
freda_ops_cockpit_beta_0_2_3_clean_repo/server
```

The files above should be directly visible at the repo root.

## Render settings for a clean repo

Use these settings:

```text
Root Directory: server
Build Command: npm install
Start Command: npm start
```

Environment variables:

```text
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=10000
REPORTING_PHPSESSID=<raw PHPSESSID cookie value only>
```

Use only the raw cookie value for `REPORTING_PHPSESSID`, not `PHPSESSID=...`.

Alternative:

```text
REPORTING_COOKIE=PHPSESSID=<cookie value>
```

## After deployment

Open:

```text
https://YOUR-RENDER-URL.onrender.com/?v=023clean
```

You should see:

```text
Beta 0.2.3
Freda Priorities
POS Today
Uber WTD
Square MTD / captured period
```

If an older version still appears, clear browser/PWA cache or uninstall/reinstall the home-screen app.

## Important note on POS sync

Beta 0.2.3 has better diagnostics, but if reporting.site loads KPI values through browser-side JavaScript, server-side fetch may see the page but not the rendered KPI values. In that case, the app will show diagnostics and you can use manual/browser capture until a stable API/export path is confirmed.

## Beta 0.2.7 - View Sync workflow

If `Sync reporting.site POS` does not return usable KPI values, use the new **View Sync** tab:

1. Open the source dashboard in another tab:
   - reporting.site daily_sales.php / dashboard.php / busy_hours.php,
   - Uber Eats sales-v2 with current day or this_week selected,
   - Square transactions with the required date range.
2. In Freda Ops Cockpit, open **View Sync**.
3. Select source, store and period.
4. Copy the generated bookmarklet to the browser bookmarks bar.
5. Open the source dashboard and click the bookmarklet.
6. Return to Freda Ops Cockpit and refresh summary.

For daily Uber, select the current day in Uber first and use a period like `2026-06-15`. For WTD Uber, use period `this_week`.
